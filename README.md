# RNN-LSTM Implementation from Scratch

Welcome to the repository containing implementations of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) created entirely from scratch using only `numpy`. This resource is highly recommended for those looking to understand the fundamentals of neural networks.

Embarking on this project, I viewed it as an intellectual exercise to develop these implementations. Additionally, it presented a valuable opportunity to delve into the basic concepts of RNNs and LSTMs.
